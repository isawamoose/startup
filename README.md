CS260 Startup Application - Collaborative Songwriter

Made by Stephen Amos

I learned that conflicts are best avoided by pulling down changes to your local environment before making any changes.
I was already pretty familiar with git but this reinforced the principle behind source control - that if everyone edits the same document, who knows what can happen, so making multiple copies then comparing changes is pretty useful.

Elevator Pitch:

A collaborative app for songwriting on the go - in solo mode, a user can enter lyrics onscreen and then enter chords above the lyric lines. In duo mode, two users can work on the same song. Users can save the song to work on later.

Key features:
* Songwriting page
* Two modes - solo and duo
* Ability to save songs to work on later
