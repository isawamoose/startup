CS260 Startup Application - Collaborative Songwriter

Made by Stephen Amos

I learned that conflicts are best avoided by pulling down changes to your local environment before making any changes.
I was already pretty familiar with git but this reinforced the principle behind source control - that if everyone edits the same document, who knows what can happen, so making multiple copies then comparing changes is pretty useful.

Elevator Pitch:

A collaborative app for songwriting on the go - in solo mode, a user can enter lyrics onscreen and then enter chords above the lyric lines. In duo mode, two users can work on the same song.

Key features:
* Songwriting page
* Two modes - solo and duo
* Ability to save songs to work on later
